          <h2>First Generation Billionaire</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Gautam Adani</b>, born in 1962 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a self-made entrepreneur and the founder of the Adani Group. Coming from a modest family background, he left college to pursue business opportunities and began his career in diamond trading in Mumbai. In 1988, he founded Adani Exports (now Adani Enterprises), which later grew into the multinational Adani Group, operating in ports, energy, infrastructure, airports, and renewable power. Unlike many other billionaires who inherited wealth, Adani built his empire from scratch, earning him the title of a first-generation billionaire. His vision and determination have made him one of the most influential business leaders in India and across the world.
